  <p id="name">Daniel Clifford</p>
  <p id="title">Verified Graduate</p>

  <div id="testimonialText"> <h4 id="quote">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br/>
     were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I <br/>
     honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h4></div>

     <div id="testimonialText">

  “ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a <br/>
  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for <br/>
  the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 <br/>
  weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve <br/> 
  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

<div id="secondTestimonial" class="bg-secondary rounded w-25">
  <p id="name">Jonathan Walters<br/></p>
  <p id="title">Verified Graduate</p>

  <h4>The team was very supportive and kept me motivated</h4>

  “ I started as a total newbie with <br/>
  virtually no coding skills. I now work <br/>
  as a mobile engineer for a big <br/>
  company. This was one of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”

</div>


<div id="thirdTestimonial" class="bg-white rounded w-25">

  <p id="name">Jeanette Harmon<br/></p>
  <p id="title">Verified Graduate</p>

  <h4>An overall wonderful and rewarding experience</h4>

  “ Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a job I really enjoy, and make a good living 
  while doing something I love. ”

</div>

<div id="fourthTestimonial" class="bg-dark text-white rounded w-50">
  <p id="name">Patrick Abrams<br/></p>
  <p id="title">Verified Graduate</p>

  <h4>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
  learning from their experiences was easy.</h4>

  “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
  gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
  junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
  an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”

<div id="fifthTestimonial" class="bg-white rounded w-25">

  <p id="name">Kira Whittle<br/></p>
  <p id="title">Verified Graduate</p>

  <h4>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h4>

  “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
  professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former 
  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
  did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
  project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
  could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
  experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
